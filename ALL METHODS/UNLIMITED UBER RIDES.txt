
Unlimited Uber Rides Method

I’m gonna make this simple and short by just listing the things you need to do.I wouldn’t suggest doing this on your main account just in case, even though I’ve been doing it on my main account for the past 3 months.

Old Promo Code: [deleted] - didn't work.

NOTE: The Promo Code will be updated everytime it's used! Last updated: MARCH 18/2017

NEW PROMO CODE: q3wzexgnue

INSTRUCTIONS:
1) Have an Uber account (obviously)
2) If you haven’t used your first free ride, use it, if not, you can use the promo code “q3wzexgnue” for a free $30 ride.
3) Use the ride whenever you’d like.
4) DELETE your uber account here: https://help.uber.com/h/24010fe7-7a67-4ee5-9938-c734000b144a it’ll ask you to sign in and give a reason. Say it’s for personal reasons.
5) Within 1-2 hours your account will be deleted and unrecoverable. Sometimes it happens in a matter of minutes. You’ll receive an email when it’s deleted.
6) Open your Uber app and you’ll see that you’re no longer signed in. Sign up again using the same email, name, number, credit card, etc. And apply the same “q3wzexgnue” promo code again when signing up. Once you use the ride, just repeat the steps above.

ENJOY!
