
G2A Method

Basics
Yeah,another affiliate link thing.

In the G2A Goldmine,each people that buys a game under your affiliate link,you earn a predefined amount of money.
Example:Someone buys The Division ( https://www.g2a.com/r/user-595761048404a ) under your affiliate link,you will earn $1,19.
 
Hierarchy
The hierarchy system is something that you always must have in mind. Not all of the gamers who click on your link have to purchase something. 
You can form your own affiliate team and make them spread your link around the Internet, and you'll still be gaining money. 
The hierarchy system is explained by this illustration on g2a: You're on top, and your level 1 gamers make you 100% of the income. 
Level 1 gamers refer level 2 gamers, from which you get 60% (and your level 1 gamer gets 100% from the earning). 
The level 2 gamers refer level 3 gamers, from which you earn 40% (your level 1 gamers earn 60%, and your level 2 gamers earn 100%). 
The more you earn, the bigger percentage you get from every sale. You start with around 10% from each sale.
So if you find good affiliates,this can almost be an autopilot method.

Marketing
You should focus your marketing to streamers and youtubers,if they create a account under your ref link,and start to divulgate their own link,
you will profit for that (remember to always have the hierarchy system in mind).
Don't spam the streamers/youtubers,try to talk to them as a fan that wants them to profit more or something like that.
Posting your link on Facebook pages and reddit work great too.
If you know more about gaming,it will be more easy to convince people to click your ref link.
