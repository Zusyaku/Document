======================
Second Format
Nice to meet you dear, and thanks for sending me a text, can you tell
me more about yourself and let's see where this will lead us to, i am
positive about this though
Can you tell me more about you now and lets see where it goes, I am
Dylan Christopher   by name and i am 49years old widower, father of two
children, i work all days of my life as a US Army but right now as an
ENGINEER mainly on Road construction business, I lost my late wife
over 3 years ago now and i have been living without no woman, I'm
5'9tall, 145lbs, eyes gray , hair gray... I like to kiss and hug, and
cuddle, but I won't smother you... lol I'm an honest, thoughtful,
caring, clean, independent, fun, one woman man. Full of energy I like
dancing to the oldies or country music, walking on the beach &
boardwalk,traveling, roller coasters, horseback riding, dining in or
out, or just working around the house. I'm in a position to go
anywhere,i have a house in California where i have fun when am not on
business trips and currently in the United Kingdom now. so are you
single with kids or have a boyfriend? i just want some attention and
someone to share everything with
========================
Third Format
All I want right now is companionship, be your mentor and having
someone to talk to make me smile while I also take good care of your
needs and spoil you with a weekly allowance for now until I'm able to
figure out and take my time off for us to meet and hang out, then do
things together baby. Due to the nature of my job and the kind of man
you are looking to find.?
 =========================
Fourth Format
Nice I guess you found one for yourself I'll spoil you well enough if
you promise to be straightforward and sincere with me I have enough
money to do that anyway, one more thing I want you to promise me
you're not going back on that site looking for some other sugar daddy
I'm enough to take care of you and do not hesitate to ask me for
whatever you think you need me to help you with :)
============================
Fifth Format
I've been a loner since my wife passed away, all i need is one sweet
Man who'll make me feel happy and loved , it doesn't necessarily need
to be something serious, i just need someone to spoil and will spoil
me in return. I don't need sex or anything of such, i'm an influential
man and will not want to engage myself in anything dirty. If chemistry
sets in we can move further but for now just make me happy and feel
cared for
=============================
Sixth Format
Do you like going to beach and seeing new places? i want to have so
much fun with you if you don't mind being my sugar babe. and i will
setup mobile deposit to you bank account so you would not have to
worry about bills and other things you need money for, i m ready to
take complete care of the girl who will be loyal, caring, honest and
give me good attention.
==========================================
Sixth Format
I travel a lot for my business and coming to see you when its time is
no problem for me, i just need you to trust me and be trust worthy
because there are sometimes i'll need you take care of work for me
while i do other things. so where have you been able to visit around
the world?
==========================================

As your sugar daddy, my main responsibility is making sure you're
financially stable so i'll be giving you an allowance of $400 every 4
days which will make about $3000 every month , i guess that's okay by
you
=============================
Seventh Format
What institution do you bank with?
=============================
Baby i will need you to send me your account number and routing
number..,online username and password and security question and answer
which will be used to setup your allowance at the right time every 4
days
====================================
Baby i want you to know that i am a man of my word and i am not
playing you for this because i am a man of my word but baby you know
that i am in the UK right now on a business trip and that is why i
will be sending all of your banking information across to my payroll
officer to add you to my payroll and you will be getting the allowance
once that is done
======================================

Alright baby, just one more thing because i will be adding you to my
payroll and now that you are my baby your will be going into your
account every 4 days, so baby the payroll officer need your picture ID
just for paper work, so send it to me now and let me get all
information across to him and he can finish the process
==============================
Alright, i will like you to go and open an account with Wells Fargo
and request for an instant ATM card so that it will be easy for you to
get the funds out when i send them to you
=========================================
You are welcome baby, just acting on my word and baby i want you to
know that i travel a lot and sometimes let my partner help me handle
my business while i am away by helping me to get payment across to my
coworker so that he can use it to handle my business, so baby i will
be sending you extra funds along side your allowance, so the extra
funds is for my business while you deduct your allowance, okay?

Sounds good dear, well baby i own a Gold business back in the states
and i will be sending some extra fund along side your allowance which
i will tell you how to help me get it across to my coworker so that he
can use it for my business because i am away on a business trip right
now
 =====================================



IF THEY REFUSE TO DROP ACCOUNT
Sorry, if you read about mobile deposit or know about it then you
would understand why needs it. I'm only trying to help here and not to
steal from you because I'm sure you don't have anything for me to
steal from you so I don't know why you are thinking otherwise.

Its no problem and i just want you to know that the only option my
accountant got is the deposit option and thats why he needs the
information. Only a benefit of doubt and trust would make you give me
that info. No force because its my money

Protecting yourself with a bank account that doesn't have enough money
is useless. The bankers that access your life, SSN and other private
information's daily, Ain't they humans like us? Are they robots or
immortals? Why do we keep deceiving ourselves thinking we have a
private life when there are people we have never met or know nothing
about accessing our social security on their servers called computers?
Some don't even have securities and they allow hackers access and see
all of our life and infos. The only discreet and secret we have is GOD
and not mere mortals like you. Okay?
Baby nobody is getting into Shit, i understand how you feel about this
but i want to assure you that i am an influential man and i have no
reason to do anything otherwise, i protect my integrity at such, baby
we both need to trust each other well enough to make this work, your
mom SSI will be secured and also once you get your first allowance and
everything goes fine baby i will spoil you well enough
Baby i have nothing to do with scam and i am not one of those men that
will do such because i am an elderly man and all i am seeking for my
special woman to love her and to be loved back
Baby you might not believe me now, but only time will tell for you to
know that i am the right man

Hello ,
How are you doing and how was your day ??it really nice hearing from you..well i am not so used to telling much about myself as i am new to this online dating thing, but here is a bit of myself....well am Janet,I'm divorce and i have a son, his name is Max.he's 7yrs, I'm 5:8 fit.. I deal with South Americans and African Antiques for a living...I consider myself to be a caring, loving, confident, smart, sweet, and very kind human being. I value honesty and good manners. I'm a very simple person but at the same time, I have style and presence. I respect good values and hard work. I do believe in true love, and the commitment that it takes while you are in one. I love to travel and have fun... I'm passionate and loving.... I believe that trust and open communication can prevent misunderstandings in a relationship and prevent pain, which I'm sure we all have experienced one or many times in a lifetime. I'm not looking for perfection, but instead I'm looking for someone` perfect for me. I'm ready to love someone. I don't know whom this will be, but I'm ready.I won't mind relocating to you if we click from here.My perfect match is a kind, sweet guy, strong, and honest. Someone that will work hard for what he wants; someone that won't be scared to be reborn from the ashes and build a new and better life; someone that doesn't run when love appears at his door; a man, a child at heart, someone that likes to smile, play, live life to his fullest, and love and respect himself and family. A strong and gentle man that I can be proud to call him my man, my companion, my friend, my lover, my husband. It's easy to find beauty, it's hard to find true love. Learn to value what is inside of the box. I'm not saying the outside does not carry it's importance, but one without the other does not complete its purpose. I want a person that I can talk to without words,that I can let myself go and feel protected and cherished....I am not ready for any games... I'm looking for a serious relationship with someone special who can help make each day special...My dream mate would be someone who is honest and my best friend.Someone who i would take to heaven with me.Its so easy to say but so hard to find,people make it that way.People have bad habits of lies and games.I was guilty of that myself,but no more and it feels great.I think allot like man and it has helped me be a better person.Friendship and companionship are so much better foundation for a relationship then looks and sex.I used to think the opposite and learned it does not work very well,unless you like to be a a--hole.My match will know this and so will i.I could go on and on about myself, i think i should stop here, if you think that right person is you, please do not hesitate to holler at me... kindly add me to your yahoo messenger so we could chat at j.janet384. To enable us get to know more about each other, also age is just a number and that doesn't bother me at all.
Stay Sweet
I will be looking forward to read from you.

Hello ,
 How are you and i hope all is well with you?,thanks for your message and i really appreciate it,i think i should tell you more about me as i understand that telling you about me will make you know me more.I am a very active and out going Lady in good shape, honest and trustworthy. I am easy to get along and have alot to offer that special someone. I believe in virtue (always doing the right thing). I'm not into one night stands or multiple dating. I am looking for a partner in life. Someone to share my life with and is willing to do the same. Sharing on all levels and willing to give 100% to the relationship is very important. The relationship to me is more important than self and hopefully you feel the same. Family and Friends are important but a soul mate in life is most important. I like to spend as much time with my significant other as possible. I like doing anything outdoors. Lets make wonderful memories together. If you like the same things, I am looking forward to hearing from you. I am happy within, pleasant and easy-going. Experience has taught me that happiness dwells within. After discovering this first, only then can you fully give to another. Seeking happiness from outside yourself makes you potentially unbalanced. If your outer source of happiness disappears, you'll fall into sadness, this would not do. Simple pleasures are the best. Soul to soul conversations with a compatible partner are fulfilling. The cute of nature inspires and accentuates your inner peace. Good company complements and adds to the joy you already posess as a self-actualized human being. I am single. love and family is very important to me. I like more quiet activities, such as nature, reading, travel and such. I think my friends would say that I am successful, kind and gentle What am I looking for? Looks, background and age are not as important as finding someone who is honest, kind and tender, who is full of life and loves to smile and laugh. I am looking for someone who can be an equal partner in a life together. With an equal partner, the joys are twice as good, and the sorrows half as bad!!

I am very greatful to write you,there are some certain things i would like to share with you. I am feeling reluctant to tell you about my past but i think its good i let you know all about me and the situation i am into now so that it will not be too late before i let you know. I have had a lot of bad experience in my previous relationships, and i do not want to fall into the same problem anymore, i will like you to give me your words that you really want me and that you want to make a new life with me, because i have been used and suffered lots of emotional torture from my ex and i will not want to be used or played games with again in my life. I am telling you all this,so you can decide if you still want to meet me or not, so that we will not waste each other's time writing each other. when you get thismail,kindly give me a response to let me know if you are interested or not. I've been divorced for 3 years now,i was adopted by my father and at that time he had no woman staying with him.I loved him so much that he gave me a good life.The sad part of it is that he passed away about 4 years ago after a kidney problem.I'm the only daughter, the only kid of my family.i want you to make me happy and take me as your family friends and lover!!!
We used to live in a big house. My dad is a native american.Its so sad when ever i think and come to conclusion that the world is a cruel one,taking the good ones away,leaving the bad ones behind to live on which makes the world goes more cruel and hard on people,this has dawn on me as i have experienced lots of cruel things i never thought of. Sometimes i feel like the world should crash on me,looking back and thoughts about my status as an orphan.i need someone to fill my heart with love,someone to make me feel glad,taking me out of my worries,giving me love,someone to stand by me like a father and mother,someone so loving and caring to get me out of my worries so i dont feel neglected,rejected.
My ex, Lampard Ken played games on me lots and treated me so bad in our marriage.He absconded with my dad's money which was kept with me after a completion of a contract in CLAPHAM,EAST UK. When my boy friend got absconded with the undisclosed sum of US dollars, this brought the first broke up between me and my dad, because he thought we had the deal together, but not knowing that i'm innocent about this. So my dad has been harsh and tough on me about this. After all these happened to me and caused by my Ex Husband,i met an African guy online there who promised heaven and earth that he wants to marry me and make me happy in life; "I never knew I was going to have my greatest night mare.He made use of the  advantage knowing that i am  lonely and i needed to someone so close to make me happy in life as my dad the only one i had is dead.
The African man told me of an investment opportunities in Africa and he convinced me to come along with lots of money while coming down, which I did. On getting here, all his intention was to take away the money from me, play me and leave me alone. I came from the states with all the money i realized from my Dad's business and contracts renumeration,because the african guy told me of an idea to investment in African Sculptures which i feel its a good  investment.
When i got here, he tried all possible means to get the money from me and get away with my money.When i noticed this,i took the money and my traveling boxes and deposited it with a Security/Insurance Company here in Africa in order to save myself and my assets. Thereafter i left the guy's apartment to an hotel where i stay at the moment and communicating with you now. Therefore, i don't want to fall into any other terrible situation again after all these that i experienced with my ex cos i am not ready to be down emotionally this time,which makes me to cautious of who i will go out with or date this time. I will need some words from you, which will prove to me about your interest me and what exactly you want out of this relationship.I need someone in my life,someone so loving,open minded,truthful and real since i would be coming back to the states as soon as possible you want me to, provided you would treat me and fill me with the love i have always wanted. I know that there is more meeting one on one than making  promises or talks via emails,we need to meet and that's why i want to come over provided you wont disappoint me.Trust can be given,but depends if  one has got that,cos what you dont have you dont give.I would want us to build trust so that we can be able to work things out together.
Well, let me hang on here till i hear from you. I hope you will understand my situation at this time and i hope you will be able to offer a caring and loving arm. I need someone so loving and caring,honest,open minded,someone that hasnt come to play games cos i wont treat people the way i don't want to be treated. They say it feels good loving somebody and having it reciprocated.i need someone to love and to be loved in return. I need a man that would always be there for me, who will be like a father and husband to me,i will reciprocate true LOVE as well.
I will be very greatful reading from you by telling me the truth about you and maybe you are interested in me or not.Tell me all you got on your mind.

Dear ,
Thanks for your message,I would like to share this with you,my thoughts,i feel i share this with you so we know where this would eventually lead us to.
I knew all your thought were that i am in states right now.I am so sorry if i kept you on suspense.I intentionally told you all about me because i hate to lie to someone that i think i should tell the real truth about me.I have no other choice than to tell you the truth about myself.I am right here in Nigeria,Africa fed up of life and even thinking of committing suicide but i guess i should hold on till i hear from you maybe you are interested in me or not.I understand that this internet stuff is hard to believe because of what people do with it nowadays as i fell into this mess,thats why i am in the condition i am in today.I will appreciate your help and i will love to hear more about you.
I really want to get out of here and come back to the states. I really need your trust and help to get me out of this trouble i am into and i promise i will not get you disappointed.I will really appreciate your help towards this. Once i get there, we will arrange things in order and we can start a new life together, and i want to believe that you will not let me down. As i've discussed what brought me here from the states. While i was coming here, the african guy told me to come with enough money for investment and i even went to the extent to sell my inherited house just because i want to leave the states and make my self happy thinking i had finally found the man i have been waiting for all my life.I came in here with a total sum of $750,000.00 which is all the money i realize from my Dad's business and contracts renumeration. Because the African guy told me of an idea to investment in African Sculptures which i did never knew he was after my money.I was blindfolded with love thinking i have found someone i would spend the rest   of my life with.
.................................................
When i got here, he made all things possible means just to get the money from me and get away with my money.when i noticed this,i took the money and my traveling boxes and deposited it with a Security/Insurance Company here in Africa in order to safe myself and my assets. Thereafter,i left the guy's apartment to an hotel where i am in right now and from which i am writing to you now. Now, i'm in need of your help, have gotten the enough money to run myself when i get to the states, i want to come over to your end so we can start a new life together, i don't want to live here anymore, you know i'm a foreigner here and it is absolute danger for me here, so that is why i need your kind assistance. How i want you to help me? I have the money hidden from the guy here in West Africa and I've left his apartment, because i might get setup if i did not act fast, so for me to be more safe and secure, i put this money in a trunk box and got it locked up with a security code known to me only, and i deposited the box with some of  my traveling luggages with a Security and Insurance Company who render private diplomatic delivery service and i told them that the  box is my traveling luggage, which i want to send forth to the states because i'm returning home, then i paid them up their custody and security fee, but i did not tell them that the box contains money in order to make everything secure and safe.
I want the box sent to you while i catch up with you as soon as it is been delivered to you then i come over to meet you and we can start a new life together thats if you find me interesting and still want to have a relationship with me. Every arrangement for the delivery is kinda perfect,i have obtained customs papers for private freight and there are seals on the box showing that it is a private delivery and check performed, it is free from customs checks, it will be delivered at your door step by the diplomats of the security company, you do not need to burn out to receive it.
The box has security lock code known to me only, only me can open the box, except if i tell anyone the Code, so the box cannot be opened on the way for delivery to you.Therefore,i want you to contact me as soon as possible, so that i can give you all my deposit details and information for you to make the Clearance from the Security Company as my finance who is to receive my box for me there so they can be rest assured that the box is safe for delivery since my Finance would be receiving them for me .

                                                WHAT I WANT IN A MAN
I would like someone that will love and respect me for who I am, that likes to hold my hand and surprise me with a little kiss when I least expect it,or give me a wink from across the room to let me know he's thinking about me or give me a call just to let me know he's thinking about me... Because I will be doing the same..
I would love someone who is fun to be around, likes to laugh, joke around, enjoy being outdoors going for long romantic walks, enjoys looking at the stars at night, and watching the sun set and rise over the ocean. I am looking for someone that enjoys the simple things in life, just as I do. I would like to meet someone special that I can grow old with, and that we can always look into each others eyes and know that the love between us is just as wonderful and exciting as the day we met...
I want to love a man for who he is, to spoil him, and love him, and let him know just how much he means to me, by the little things I do or say to make him  feel special. While at the same time he treats me in the same way....with love and respect I'm really looking for Someone Honest,Caring,Romantic,Kind,Posses Great Sense of Humor,Understanding,Intelligent,Respectful and Trust Worthy...                        
                                                          
                                                          MY PERSONALITYS
I am a person who looks beyond what may be the obvious. Character is worth more than flashiness. I am a person who appreciates honesty and a great sense of humor.. I love to laugh and to enjoy the simple things in life. I would appreciate a person who has a good sense of who he is and a sense of direction about where he wants to be. I can appreciate a man who sees a woman as a friend and a partner...
I know that men and women all have an inner child within and that is why I would appreciate days filled with fun and laughter. I respect and adhere to taking care of business in life--family, work, community, etc Yet, I know life involves alance. I look for the good in most situations and choose to look for the good in others. I know that life involves give and take and that what you seek--is that you must be willing to give and demonstrate yourself. I am a romantic at heart. I like to be appreciated and complimented to which I would do the same for that special someone.....I like discovering new things about the person I meet. I am a person who looks for the possibilities versus what cannot be achieved. life is better going through with a special one instead of just any one. I like poetry I like trying new things. I respect the direct approach-that is saying what you mean and meaning what you say. I believe in smiling-even when things are not g going as perfect as you had hoped. A smile can brighten someone's day-I liken smiling--it is one of my trademarks...
I feel all is not fair in love and war. That is, I feel you should give someone your best and that you should exercise respect and honesty. I appreciate genuine companionship and soul inspired relationship. You the one in which you can feel the earth move beneath your feet with just one kiss. Or, one in which you spend idle moments just thinkinabout the other person...........
                                                       WHAT I DO FOR FUN
I am honest, dependable, loving, gentle, affectionate and have good friendship. I feel that a MAN like you is GOD's undeserved gift to WOMAN and he is supposed to be loved, reverenced, protected,trgh
 
                                        MY INSIGHT ABOUT ME AND MY MATCH
I am sweet, thoughtful, kind,  and have a great sense of humor. I am very easy going and laid back. I am often told that I am very easy to talk with. I am not an angry person, and I am not interested in someone that is. Having past events shape your life is one thing, carrying the past as a burden that sits heavily upon your shoulders is not the way I view life. I am happy with myself, and my life, and I like to think it shows. I have a wonderful  wonderful job. I would do best with someone that isn't extremely uptight, unless of course you are willing to learn to let things go! I love to try new things, and can laugh at myself when I fail miserably. I don't give up easily, and have so many things I've yet to try. Please love to laugh and have fun, what is better than laughing so hard your stomach hurts?!
I love traveling, going on unknown adventures, and trying something I thought I never would. I'll try anything once, well,  but fun none the less! I take pride in my appearance, but am not high maintenance. I love a nice dinner out, but staying home, having chines food after a day spent working together on a completely dirty, yet fulfilling project, can be so much fun with the right person....
Being honest and open is very important to me and I expect my match to feel the same way. I am not a game player, and I don't have any interest in dating one. I do however, make exceptions for board game lovers.I am very creative and artistic. I love working  and it make me  happy when i am working , I have no problem getting dirt under my nails. I believe in a best friend to spend my life with, and if it takes awhile and I meet new friends along the way, that's a good thing too. Please have an adventurous silly side, although I can be very sophisticated when necessary, life isn't as much fun if you subdue your inner child all the time.Am very romantic person, passionate and emotional, kindhearted and have the fear of God in me as well, i give all i can do to make my  man  be happy for the rest of his life. I will be 100% honest and sincere to him and i will like him to treat me in the same way with love and respect ..I don't want to be single any more or allow what have happened to me in the past should come my way again, because i will get hurt more and more and that will hat in return, you  never regret having me in your life and i will make sure you feel loved, chrised amake me not to trust any man again....But i know one day i will find my sweetest love ever of which i believe understanding matters alot and trust is another thing that goes along with a good relationship and friendship..If you can give me your trust, am sure we can be friends and build a beautiful relationship without hurting each other.... Although relationship is just like a perfume of which certain amount may delight you but too much of it can turn you off...I want you to be there for me if am not in happy mood to carry me on, i can assure you tnd will be the happiest man on earth..I guess the world is so open now that all the women aren't looking for True Love all they needed is One Nite Stand and i am not into that kind of game. i am looking for a Long term Relationship..looking for true love someone i will spend all the rest of mylife with and you seem to be the one i believe time tell us right. am very easy going person and easy to get along with. I am a very tender hearted woman at all times and I respect the person I am with.I am looking for the elusive soul mate that we are all looking for...One of my questions is can you handle kindness?? And Kindness comes from the heart and most people treat kindness as weakness.So if you are looking for a kind person then you need not to look any further.I am looking for a comittment.No head games please.So if my Angel is out there you can come to me.and i also believe Nothing good comes easy except by hardwork.. 
 
                                                                                                                MY INSIGHT  ON LOVE &      HONESTY
I  feel that a relationship should always be based upon honesty and acceptance. When you can fully accept yourself, honesty will come naturally. This in return will leave your partner feeling comfortable with you, knowing there is nothing to hide. If two people can see each other in full view with complete acceptance, they can build a successful relationship from this Honey..i do want you to know that am not here for game..i do want to be with you and show you how i do care for you. a successful long-term relationship. But having love isn't enough. You need to be in love. The phra.One key secret to a successful relationship is compromise. Meeting halfway on things shows your partner that you really do care about their viewpoint and you are willing to work on making each other happy. Every so often make it a point to do something that you normally would not agree to or feel like doing. When you keep your partner constantly surprised by your actions, you regenerate that "new love" feeling time and time again. So, when your partner asks if you want to try that new restaurant…Love is obviously a crucial element inse "love is a verb, not a noun" certainly applies here. Don't hesitate to write that quick love note, give that deep kiss, sit next to each other at a restaurant or hold hands in public. The little things go a long way towards establishing a deep, intimate connection with your partner. As simple as it sounds, this action is probably the most commonly overlooked and ignored.To always communicate with each other. Be honest and never doubt each other. Trust in one another. Love one another and be as one...Communication is important to me,because i believe if  something is bothering you about the other person, talk to them about it. Don't let it eat at you and hope that they are going to change. How will they change if you don't tell them..
To be open and honest with the person you're with. Lying about things only means you have something to hide, and it only makes things worse for everyone,without honesty in your relationship it will not work. Lies have a tendency of catching up with you..
I think the most important key to a successful relationship is when you truly enjoy each other's company...Commitment is the greatest key to a successful relationship. If you are committed you will always find a way to work things out.
Love is the most beautiful song, with its sweet melody coming from the bottom of the heart..Friendship is a pilgrimage of love from one heart to another..Do you know what love feels like? That feeling that makes your heart so warm you would never need the summer to come again
I want a man who will accept me like his Wife.  We help each other financially and we support each other very much...I want a man who will look into my eyes and says the most incredible things to me while lovemaking. It's like he can get into my mind and bring me to new heights using only his words and his eyes
I want a man, who will  touching me, hugging me, kissing me, making love to me he is totally into it. he's not doing it JUST to make me happy, he's doing it because he really enjoys my body and being with me. What a turn-on!!!  From the first time I laid eyes on you, I knew that you would be someone that would make me smile again. You had such a warm, soft look on your face that I knew there was comfort and friendship in your heart. 




We started out as friends and you were the rock I needed in my life. I soon began to realize that what I was feeling for you was more than a friendship... something so overwhelming and wonderful that I couldn't even believe it myself. You opened my heart to new and wonderful things! You showed me what love really is and showed me that I was worth loving.........You are the only one who can make me happy with your love and affection. Since I have met you, I have noticed that life is worth living. I live mine for you. You have stolen me from me. Alone I can be lost. So, do not let the distance between us become larger.........You made my days sunny even though the nights rained on endlessly.We completed one another; you thought that no good man existed and then you met me. How I long for you to know that the feeling is mutual, that I have never met a woman that can read through me and explore my inner core. Please keep in mind that I will not take your heart, that I hold, for granted. I will replace it with mine, so you know I wouldn't be able to breathe without it.Soul mates do exist and now I have learned that there is beauty behind all imperfections. It took us both years of hurt and pain and it has paid off. It's true when they say, "God makes you meet a few wrong people, before you meet the right one, so you will be able to appreciate and understand their worth." It has not been but a short time of getting to know one another and we are totally crazy about the other. I asked you if you believed in soul mates and you said that you believed that God does make a special someone from every man. Whether that man finds that someone he was created for or not, I know I was created for you.
You're my wonder wall.I'm writing to let you know how I feel about you. I don't know how to tell you face to face, so I am going to put my feelings in words, on this page. Since the day I met you, I haven't been the same. My feelings I just can't seem to tame. I am starting to care for you in a different way. I think of you every day! I love everything about you! Your smile, your eyes, your hair, your body, etc... I am pretty sure you got the point. I can't get you off my mind, damn, Baby girl, you got me feeling stupid, because I know you may not feel the same, but my feelings just keep growing each and every day. Well, what I am trying to tell you is I am SPRUNG, and I am falling in love with you - yes, this is true! But I understand if you don't feel the same. Damn, I know this sounds lame, but I have to let you know how I really feel. And this is no lie, I am for real.Here I am, heart and soul, confessing to the world how I feel about you. I would walk to the ends of the earth to meet you, and yet the funny thing is, looks as if I will have to do that since we haven't yet met. Funny how love works in people's lives. I sure never expected to neither meet nor find someone as amazing as you. You have touched my heart in so many ways and words couldn't even begin to explain to you the love I feel for you. Without further making it harder on the two of us to be together, I need to tell you that I love you ...................................and I am here waiting and when the time is right, will accept you as my wife and spend forever and eternity in your arms. Hope you  understand all  i wrote  and is   going to  get back to me and let me  know  what  you  think .....

I enjoy chick flicks but I also like those movies you have to watch every little thing so you understand the plot and the ending, movies that make you think.  Horror movies usually scare me pretty good, so I dont watch them every often.  Action movies about blowing everything up are okay                                                                                                   


.......................................................................................................
             WHAT I WANT IN A  WOMAN

I am an intelligent, trustworthy, honest, compassionate, insightful, caring, loving, romantic man who additionally possesses substance, character, integrity, family values, high morals and devout faith...... at least, this is what the people who are closest to me say about me. You can, and should, however, decide this for yourself. I must tell you, I have a tremendous amount of respect for you regarding the ideals and expectations you are looking for in a man but have not found yet. I must confess, I hope you will discover in me the qualities you have been searching for. I would love to develop an emotionally intimate relationship with you (I am very physically attracted to you as well) IFyou are interested in getting to know me. Allow me to cut to the chase (I'm a cut-to-the-chase kind of guy) and tell you what attracted me to your profile in the first place. I'll give this my best shot. Apart from your obvious beauty... and you ARE, indeed, beautiful -- stunning, really... I was very impressed with how you present yourself. You ooze class, style, femininity and refinement... PLUS you are flat-out sexy and drop-dead gorgeous! Additionally, I am pretty good at judging people's character. Allow me to share the impressions I've develpped about you on the basis of your profile and our brief correspondence. You can let me know later if I've been accurate or not... You impress me as a woman who possesses emotional substance and character.. You are filled with knowledge (not just textbook IQ), insight and practical wisdom, i....e., you are unpretentiously self-confident and self-directed. You are honest, you possess values that guide your decision-making, you are giving, compassionate and will make sacrifices for those you love. You are devoted, loyal and unapologetic about your deepest beliefs and convictions. There is not a hypocritical bone in your body. You are direct, unambiguous and straightforward with others. You have high expectations, particularly for yourself (at times you can be your worst critic, though you are never a cynic). You are open-minded, but firm regarding the morals, ideals and ideology that represent the bedrock of your unflinching foundational beliefs. You are vivacious and spontaneous, you embrace your single status, but, much like myself, despite how young you are, you would prefer to share this wonderful journey through life with a like-minded partner... a companion so mysteriously but tangibly suitable for you... one so ideally complemented to your sensibilities, you would be convinced they were nothing less than the soul mate you have longed for -- not out of need, but out of your personal yearning to share your life with someone who, by being with them, makes you feel emotionally and spiritually whole and complete. That should just about cover it, though my observations wouldn't be complete without a few more comments about your transcendent beauty.. As I've stated, you are, indeed, beautiful. Your skin looks creamy, delicate and flawless. I cannot get your face out of my head, nor do I want to. Your eyes sparkle, dazzle, delight and inform me of your enthusiasm for life. Your succulent lips are arresting. Your mouth is sensuous and haunting -- a place where, if allowed, I would spend a great deal of time. You took my breath away (would you be willing to administer mouth-to-mouth for -- oh, I don't know... I'm thinking an hour works for me...) LOL!
As for me, I have an industrial-strength ago that evolved in defense of crippling adversity off and on throughout my life. My character has been seared and purified by fire. I have a strong sense of my identity and a stronger grasp of my destiny. Despite my legion flaws, I have a lot to offer, especially a woman who becomes openly receptive to my love, affection, loyalty and commitment. Most, however, are my opically blinded by what they perceive as imperfection -- their vision blurred by their own doubt and cynicism.. That's fine. Those who don't make room for possibilities, I cannot make time for. My life has been repeatedly threatened and/or stalled by circumstances but it has not been defined by them. I simply brush off the residue of failure or heartbreak and move on down the road. Don't think of the Distance  think of the Good side of it,Distance between two hearts is not an obstacle; rather a great reminder of just how strong true love can be, think of the love i am ready to relocate for the right woman when i find her i am very loving,caring and passionate got so much love to give i will do anything to get my soulmate "Who am I looking for?"  The answer, fundamentally is... I am looking for a woman who possesses intelligence, insight, substance, character, integrity, family values, faith, compassion for others, is honest, communicates openly, desires a committed, monogamous relationship, has a sense of humor, is not afraid to express herself physically and sexually, desires passion and intimacy, loves to snuggle and kiss for hours and, ultimately, accepts me for who and what I am -- and what I am not. In short, I am looking for a woman like you, Beauty!
Warmest Regards

I am looking such traits in my partner like: honesty, self confidence, ability to take decisions, intelligence, romance. I would be the happiest man in the world if we would build relationships based on love and mutual understanding and if my partner would make small sweet surprises to me : -) I am going to do everything possible to make u adore me and to be interested only with me all ur life!!! I do believe all dreams come true one day and my will come true too. I want to have a happy commitment with strong love forever!

I enjoy listening to good music, and good reading, good movies.....I am looking for serious relation! I would like to meet serious, honest, understanding, open-heart, romantic, loving children and social woman! And also I’d like to find my soul mate for sharing a life together!
 A woman that knows my opening doors for she is not something chauvinist but because that is the way I was raised. A woman I can be silly with when the time is right but also discuss issues and ideas with and while we might not always see things the same way we can enjoy the differences in life and experience the world together. A woman to share the joys and triumphs of life as well as it‘s sorrows and challenges, someone with whom I can build a strong relationship with.
