Carding from Dell (working march2013)


1. Fresh Drop (if ur drop is blacklist in DELL u won't pass even ur CC is good)
2. Good CCV (non-VBV or non-MSC)
3. Sock / VPN / SSH / VPS (tis not important, but good sock at same state of CC is better)

Now, let start:

A - If You Want To Make Only Single Order With Single Cvv2 ( Which is Valid and virgin Ofcourse !! )


1- first check the cc and make sure it`s Valid .. choose Your Item (Fast-track items)

2- Click On Add To Cart Then Check Out , You Will Be Prompted To Sign Up For A New User Or Sign In If You Have An Existing Account ( Sign Up For A New Account )

3- Enter The First And Last Name For Your Drop As The Account First And Last Name In The Sign Up Page , Provide A Valid Email address And Password .

4- You`ll Be Redirected To The Shipping Info Page , You`ll Find The First Name and Last Name Provided In The Sign Up Page Stored There , Just Add The Address and Other Info

*Note : You Don`t Have To Provide A Valid Phone Number For Shipping Address , The Billing Phone Also Works For Shipping

5- Choose The Fastest Shipping Method (Next Day Air ) Also 2nd Day air will work , but Make Sure The Total Amount Doesn`t Exceed 470-480 $

6- On The Billing Page , Remove The Shipping Info Stored . Then Add The Billing Info Which Must Be Same As stored In Bank ( Make Sure The CC Is 100 % Valid ) The Most IMPORTANT PART HERE IS THE BILLING PHONE NUMBER

which must be the same stored with bank coz they use this number for verification ( not calling the card holder , but to verify the info with bank )

7- Don`t Choose Any Limit In The Billing Page ( Choose:No Limit )

Click Submit !!


B- IF You Intend To Use The Same Card More Than Once To Order More Than 1 Item ;

*First Note That This Method May Get You In Trouble If You Send These Items To Your Own Home , Also the items May get returned to shipper before You Recieve Them .

1- Follow The 1st Method For Ordering Single Item With 1 Cc , you`ll recieve 2 emails after ordering ( Dell Order Acknowledgement - Dell Order Confirmation ) as soon as You Recieve The Second Email Which Is : Dell Order Confirmation

check the order status in 10 - 30 minutes IF You See Something Like (In-Production Or Pre-Production ) Go To The Next Step .

2- Make Another Order and which must not exceed 480 $

3- Follow All Previous Steps ( Storing Your Credit Card Info Will Ease The Mission )

4- Repeat This For As Many Times as The Limit Of The CC Allow .

5- Don`t Make Any Orders If The Previous Order Status Isn`t ( In-Production OR Pre-Production )

6- If They Suspect One Of The Orders They Will Cancel All Orders . Ofcourse Next Day Shipping Method Will Decrease The Chance Of Getting Items Returned To Shipper .

That`s All , And Enjoy Your Carding Of DELL

P/s:
1. iIf U don't want to get problem with VBV or MSC, use Lolifox browser,with this browser Dell won't ask u for VBV even though your CC is VBV, where to get it... Google is ur friend (try and see, its my trick in DELL )
2. if you recieve the Hold payment emails, don't abandon it, try to chat with DEll's customer service, and tell them u want to give new CC for your order, then give them new CCV infomation (this time they don't check VBV or MSC)
3. with my experience, find Credit Signature CC, its have more % success
